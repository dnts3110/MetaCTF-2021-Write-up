## Participate as a Team: 
This CTF had a wide range of topics and certainly, there were not a lot people who can be an expert in everything; thus, being in a team will be much more beneficial than going solo. Unfortunately, in this CTF, 2 of my teammates were busy because of work and the last one need have assignment in his uni, so I mostly solve these challenges by myself. For the next CTF event, I will look up its detail on [https://ctftime.org/](https://ctftime.org/), join their discord and try to find commited teammates.

## Research CTF tools:
In this CTF, I think I had opened more than 10 tabs for some challenges, which was messy and stressful. There should be tools on github that are used for CTF and cyber security in general. I will need to learn more about these tools as well as other knowledge related to cyber security in order to achieve better result next time.

## Documentation / Writeup:
Continue to documenting carefully every steps I take in future CTF events and learn how to do it more efficiently.
